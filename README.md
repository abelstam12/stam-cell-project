# Crypt interactive stem cell simulation
Simulating several stem cell models

## Goal
The goal is to tweak the model such that the results from the experiments can be duplicated with this simulation, as well as illustrating the results of different (wrong) assumptions to students.

## Assumptions
Stem cell contained in the Crypt can divide in a random direction, or in a direction towards the edges when direction is not set to random. 

## Other models
The player can choose to see how the population behaves when the stem cells divide only in the direction with the lowest energy (to the outside of the crypt).

### Experiments
From experiments it is known that it takes approximatly 3 months untill the crypt is dominated by the offspring of a single stem cell. The crypt contains a relativly constant amount of 15 stem cells. Cells tend to divide symmetrically each day.
